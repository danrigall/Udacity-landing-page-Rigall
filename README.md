## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


## Student Notes

I, Dan Rigall, attempted to follow all of the instructions for this project, including both mandatory and suggested guidelines.


## Javascript

I defined all of the global variables at the top of the js file. I tried to minimize the number of global variables to help readability of the code, but couldn't seem to get it smaller than five in number.

The next section was, by default, 'Helper Functions' followed by 'Main Functions'. It wasn't super clear to me how to separate these two function categories out, but I made my best guess.

Following functions is the 'Events' section where I put all of my event listeners. I tried to minimize these also, but ended up using seven.


## HTML

The main html modifications I made were to add buttons, as well as a few text mods. Even though this project was primarily a javascript exercise, I felt like it would be too messy to try and add this html content with js. I did, however use js to add funcitonality to these added html elements.


## CSS

I updated some of the pre-existing css to make it a little different, to help adapt it to mobile sizes better, and to accomodate the html changes I made.
