## Introduction

This is the 2nd project of 5 in my Udacity "Front End Web Developer" Nanodegree. It focuses primarily on Javascript, highlighting ES6 elements specifically. In order to focus on Javascript, the html & css was given to me mostly complete in the starter files. I made only small, yet significant changes to both html & css.


## Javascript

I defined all of the global variables at the top of the js file. I tried to minimize the number of global variables to help readability of the code, but couldn't seem to get it smaller than five in number.

The next section was, by default, 'Helper Functions' followed by 'Main Functions'. It wasn't super clear to me how to separate these two function categories out, but I made my best guess.

Following functions is the 'Events' section where I put all of my event listeners. I tried to minimize these also, but ended up using seven.


## HTML

The main html modifications I made were to add buttons, as well as a few text mods. Even though this project was primarily a javascript exercise, I felt like it would be too messy to try and add this html content with js. I did, however use js to add funcitonality to these added html elements.


## CSS

I updated some of the pre-existing css to make it a little different, to help adapt it to mobile sizes better, and to accomodate the html changes I made.
